## Smartphone Test Farm Setup Examples

[Smartphone Test Farm](https://github.com/openstf/stf) is a great tool to create on-premise device farm. And also, it is very easy to get started with it using it's `stf local` feature. But the problem is, this feature was developed for development purpose. Users are not supposed to use it in production. It is okay to use it for a small farm of 10 ~ 15 devices with one host machine. But to scale you will have to deploy it over a cluster instead.

This project will provide various setup examples of STF in production environment. I will be using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) provider to create virtual cluster for demonstration.

## Assumptions
- This project assumes that you already have read following nicely written documents. In case you haven't read, it is highly recommended to read them before going ahead.
  - [STF README](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/README.md)
  - [STF DEPLOYMENT DOC](https://github.com/openstf/stf/blob/master/doc/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- You are on OS X
  - *Theoritically this can be done on any OS which supports VirtualBox and Vagrant but they haven't been confirmed yet!*

## Requirements
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) >= 5.1.0
- [VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) >= 1.8.5

## Setup Architecture
Before going any further, I am going to give you a brief idea about what kind of setups are we going to do. Most of the setups will have two major components.
- Database Cluster
  - Cluster for running database. [Rethinkdb](https://www.rethinkdb.com) cluster.
- STF Cluster
  - Cluster where STF components will be running. (CoreOS, Ubuntu etc)

![stf_cluster_architecture](docs/stf_cluster_architecture.png)

We will be creating these clusters using Vagrant and VirtualBox. And then deploy various software components on these clusters. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a running STF on your VMs which you will be able to access on http://172.17.8.101 from your browser. Stay Excited!

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/openstf/setup-examples.git stf-setup-examples
cd stf-setup-examples
```

## Create Rethinkdb Cluster

Lets create rethinkdb cluster. Go to the `db` folder and run `vagrant up`. Yeah, thats it.

```sh
cd ./db; vagrant up
```

Above command will do following things
- Download **bento/ubuntu-16.04** image if image is not present (*this may take time depending on internet speed*)
- Launch Ubuntu VM and set its IP to `198.162.50.11`
- Install and run rethinkdb server

You can confirm if rethinkdb is up by visiting rethinkdb [admin console](http://198.162.50.11:8080)

Please have a look at [Vagrantfile](db/Vagrantfile) to have better understanding about what is happening.

**TODO**: Use 2 instances of VM for rethinkdb if somebody complains that this is not a real cluster.

## Create STF Cluster

Please check following host specific docs for STF cluster creation and deployment strategy.

- [CoreOS + Fleet](docs/coreos_fleet.md)
- [Ubuntu](docs/ubuntu.md)
